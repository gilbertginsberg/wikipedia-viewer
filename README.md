# Gilbert's Wikipedia Viewer

If you can "*just google it*", then you can "*just gilbert-wikipedia-viewer it*".
Or, as many are saying, "*just gilbert it*".

Gilbert's Wikipedia Viewer is a googly-like application built on HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. It's googly not because it possesses a set of qualities that makes it
an attractive hire for the holding company Alphabet Inc. Although that it would be.
But because it gives you a list of Wikipedia articles in response to a search term.
Like a Google search. Which means it's googly.

If you're of the curious kind, [give Gilbert's Wikipedia Viewer a go](https://codepen.io/gilbertginsberg/pen/oYrPNO).

Remember: if you can google it, you can gilbert-wikipedia-viewer it. Or gilbert it.

And remember: you can create and redefine words because language is fun.
